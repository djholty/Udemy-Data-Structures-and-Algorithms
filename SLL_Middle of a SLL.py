Write a function to find and return the middle node of a singly linked list. If the list 
has an even number of nodes, return the second of the two middle nodes.

# Solution - Middle of Singly Linked List

#     def find_middle(self):
#         slow = self.head
#         fast = self.head
#         while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
#             slow = slow.next
#             fast = fast.next.next
#         return slow

# Explanation

# The approach, often called the "fast and slow pointer" technique or "tortoise and hare" 
# algorithm, allows you to traverse the list only once, instead of first counting the 
# elements and then accessing the middle one.


# def find_middle(self): - This line defines a new method find_middle in the LinkedList 
# class. This method will be used to find the middle node of the linked list.

# if not self.head: - This line checks if the head of the linked list is None. If it is, 
# that means the list is empty and there is no middle node to find.

# return None - If the linked list is empty (i.e., if self.head is None), this line 
# will end the function and return None. This is because there is no middle node in an 
# empty list.

# slow = self.head - This line initializes the slow pointer at the head of the linked 
# list. This pointer will move one node at a time through the list.

# fast = self.head - This line initializes the fast pointer also at the head of the 
# linked list. This pointer will move two nodes at a time through the list.

# while fast and fast.next: - This line starts a while loop that will continue as long 
# as both fast and fast.next are not None. This ensures that we do not try to access a 
# None value in the next line, which would raise an error.

# slow = slow.next - This line moves the slow pointer one node forward in the list.

# fast = fast.next.next - This line moves the fast pointer two nodes forward in the list. 
# Because fast moves twice as fast as slow, by the time fast reaches the end of the list, 
# slow will be at the middle.

# return slow - After the while loop, the slow pointer will be at the middle of the 
# linked list. This line returns the slow node, which is the middle node of the list.


# Time Complexity:

# The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This 
# is because in the worst-case scenario, we have to traverse the whole linked list. 
# Here, the 'fast' pointer is moving twice as fast as the 'slow' pointer, but it 
# essentially goes through the entire list (or nearly the entire list in the case of 
# an even number of nodes), so the time complexity is proportional to the size of the 
# list, i.e., O(n).

# Space Complexity:

# The space complexity is O(1), which means that the space required does not 
# change with the size of the input linked list, hence it's constant. This is 
# because we are only using a fixed amount of space to store the 'slow' and 'fast' 
# pointers, and we are not using any additional data structures like arrays or other 
# linked lists whose size would scale with the input size. No matter how large the 
# input linked list is, we only ever need two nodes ('slow' and 'fast') at any given 
# time, so the space complexity is O(1).
